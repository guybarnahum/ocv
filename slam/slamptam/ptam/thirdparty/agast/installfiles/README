-- How to compile and use the demo program --

Adapt the OPENCV paths in the 'Makefile' and compile the sources by typing 'make'
in the program folder. Run the program by typing
    demo <image_in>
where <image_in> specifies your input image.

As result you get four images with the names oast9_16.ppm, agast7_12d.ppm, 
agast7_12s.ppm and agast5_8.ppm. These images represent the result of 
- the optimal accelerated segment test on a pixel mask of 16 pixels (with a 9 pixel arc length),
- the adaptive and generic AST with a 12 pixel diamond and square shaped mask and 
- the adaptive and generic AST with a 8 pixel mask.

With the parameters AST_THR_16, AST_THR_12 and AST_THR_8 in the 'demo.cc' file you 
can define the thresholds to adjust the corner response of the AST.
